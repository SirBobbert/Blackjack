# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of a Blackjack game in Java with up to 4 players.

## Description

The game starts with players (1-4) having a certain amount of money. The players can place bets, receive cards, split (
if it's an option) and choose to hit or stand.

The dealer follows the standard rules of hitting until reaching at least 17. The game continues until the player decides
to quit or runs out of money.

### Features

- Supports 1 to 4 players
- Players can place bets
- Players can hit or stand
- Players can split pairs
- Dealer follows standard Blackjack rules
- Simple text-based interface
- Tracks player money and bets
- Handles busts and wins/losses
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and updates
- Clear and concise comments for better understanding of the code
- KISS/DRY principles followed for clean code
- Uses standard Java libraries only, no external dependencies
- Easy to extend and add new features in the future

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE or text editor for Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode)
- Git for version control
- A terminal or command prompt to run the application

### Installing

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/SirBobbert/Blackjack.git```

### Executing program

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Build the project
3. Run the `Main` class to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
5. Enjoy playing Blackjack!

## Help

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

NOTE: there are no active tests as of this date (2024-06-10), but I plan to add some in the future to make sure the game
logic is working correctly and overall improving the robustness of the application.
